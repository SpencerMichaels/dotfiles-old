# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles, as well as scripts for setting up
a new Mac with my preferred configuration almost entirely automatically.

## ~/.gitprivate file
To avoid exposing git usernames, emails, etc., the .gitconfig within this
repository [include]s a ~/.gitprivate file. This should contain git's [user]
configuration and anything else sensitive, and is not in this repository.
